It's difficult to believe that AI, a human creation, can escape this logic. This isn't just an historical view. In fact those that want to be consistent with the scientific process would have to agree. Science looks, interprets and codifies the regularities of the universe.

The probabilistic nature of the model and the variety of the generated responses, has nothing to do with the possibility of the responses being \"true\" or \"false\" as in a human made statement.
